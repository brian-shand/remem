# Defines key terms used in README and foundational documents

lexicon:
  remem:
    term: remem
    definition: A structured reflection practice built on conversation that supports human–AI co-formation.
    notes: Not an app or product — a reflexive cognitive environment co-developed through dialogue.

  invocation:
    term: invocation
    definition: A deliberate phrase that signals intent and initiates a Remem session.
    examples:
      - "Remem, I’d like to reflect on something."
      - "Remem, help me understand what I’m feeling."
    notes: Sets tone and guides the system’s initial stance.

  mode:
    term: mode
    definition: A configured cognitive stance that shapes system behaviour during a session.
    values:
      - reflection
      - review
      - research
      - operation
      - explore
    notes: Modes scaffold the interaction to match your cognitive needs and emotional tone.

  co-participant:
    term: co-participant
    definition: The human role in Remem — not a passive user, but an active collaborator in meaning-making.
    notes: Reinforces relational, non-instrumental design.

  clarity_loop:
    term: clarity_loop
    definition: The recurring cycle of dialogue, reflection, capture, and growth within Remem.
    stages:
      - Set your stance
      - Find clarity
      - Capture and tag insights
      - Reflect beyond the session
      - Adapt and evolve
    notes: Each loop deepens understanding and builds continuity of thought.

  reflexive_practice:
    term: reflexive_practice
    definition: A design ethic in which the system evolves in response to the user’s evolving understanding.
    notes: More than adaptability — this is co-formation in action.

  structured_memory:
    term: structured_memory
    definition: The tagged archive of prior sessions, invocations, and insights.
    notes: Enables review, reflection, and continuity of thought.

  cognitive_infrastructure:
